I wanted to evaluate suicides based on several demographics information.

1. First I wanted to see the number of suicides year over year. Based on the information suicides have been steadily growing starting in the 1980's and in recent years they have skyrocketed even more.
2. I also wanted to see how the different age brackets measuered when it came to suicides. 15-24 years old had alot of suicides and then after 24 they fall off alot. I was suprised to see that the suicides increased after 65 again and after 85 that was when the suicides were at the all time high.
3. I then wanted to see how the demographics of suicides break down. As expected white was the biggest amount of suicides by a large margin based on population. I did not expect for native americans to be so high in the number of suicides. The rest of the races fit into normal based on population.
4. I then wanted to see how the suicides break down by gender. I expected the suicides to be pretty close by gender but this was not true mean commited way more suicides then woman did.
